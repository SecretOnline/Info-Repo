# Info-Repo

## [Visit the Repository](https://repo.nmsdb.info)

This is the home of the code that runs the No Man's Sky Information Repository.

The Repository is a project to have all the information about the game available and easily searchable/linkable. It doesn't store information about specific planets (or other things in the game) that have been discovered.

## How to contribute

This repository uses [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

1. Fork this repo
2. Create a `feature/` branch off `develop`. e.g. `feature/the-blob`
3. Make your changes
4. Push your changes
5. Create a [pull request](https://github.com/SecretOnline/NMS-Info/compare)
6. Wait for it to be merged
7. Congratulations, you just contributed!

Although they are no longer running, thanks to the NMS Origins team for helping add cross-site functionality while you were still going. I wish you guys all the best for future projects.

**DISCLAIMER**  
This project will likely be a mess for a long time, as I am using it to learn some stuff. You're welcome to help tidy it up if you'd like.
